# Disaster-based rescue analysis and decision-making
When disasters occur, people often can not accurately judge the disaster situation and how to take more effective rescue, which leads to further expansion of disasters and aggravation of losses. Machine learning based on IBM WATSON can predict and judge the situation of disasters, provide real-time reference, and take precise rescue measures according to the reference. At the same time, according to the international leading decision-making algorithm, in the first time Jing'z put in effective manpower and material resources to implement an emergency and efficient rescue program to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

灾害突发性大，当灾害发生时，人们往往无法准确判断受灾状况和如何采取更有效的救援，导致灾害进一步扩大，损失加剧，基于IBM WATSON的机器学习可以预估和判断灾害的状况，提供实时的参考，并根据参照采取精准的救援措施和方法，有效控制灾害的蔓延；同时根据国际领先的决策算法，在第一时间精准投入有效的人力物力，实施紧急高效的救援方案，保障人员生命财产安全。
